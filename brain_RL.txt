phase 1: bell -> meat
phase 2: bell + light -> meat
nothing learnt from light, since no eror

phase 1: bell -> meat
phase 2: light -> bell
then light -> salited, second order learned

rate of dopamine release: r - V
current reward - average of past rewards
TD

Two distinct systems:
- goal-directed: model based
  statistical efficiency
- habitual: S -> R
  computational efficiency
Meta decision problem (like modular, but not all policies available)

inferring task pushes people to use model-based learning (?)
